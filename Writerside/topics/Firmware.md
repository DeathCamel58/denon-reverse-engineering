# Firmware

The firmware for most of the inMusic devices is packaged the same, so we're able
to [extract](Extracting.md), [recompress](Recompressing.md), and [update](Updating.md) most device firmwares.

> Many of the devices can be extracted with
> the [mpcimg](https://github.com/TheKikGen/MPC-LiveXplore/tree/master/imgmaker) tool. Some of the newer devices aren't
> compatible with this tool, as inMusic added image signature checking. More of this is detailed in
> the [](Firmware-Layout.md) page.
