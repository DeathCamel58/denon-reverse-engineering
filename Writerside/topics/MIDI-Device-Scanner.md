# MIDI Device Scanner

This just seems to query the built-in MIDI device. It shells out to `amidi`.

See [](Engine-MIDI-Devices.md) for how [](Engine.md) identifies its MIDI devices, and what it does with them once found.

> Verified against the `5.0.4` release images — every one of these devices ships this application.
> Devices that share an update image share a single root filesystem, so presence is really a property of the
> image rather than the individual device; see [](Firmware.md) for the groupings. Note the binaries are *not*
> shared between images: the `AZ01` and `AZ0x` builds have matching sizes but different checksums.
